## EC-WindowsServiceControl

This plugin manipulates Windows Services. On Microsoft Windows operating systems, a Windows service is a long-running executable that performs specific functions and which is designed not to require user intervention. Windows services can be configured to start when the operating system is booted and run in the background as long as Windows is running, or they can be started manually when required. This plugin makes this easy.
